The above pinned projects are all mine, with (mostly) my code. Feel free to contibute! My preferred languages are C, Go, Shell/Bash, Python but I can also code in Java and others. I'm mostly interested in systems programming, embedded systems, back-end programming, DevOps / System Administration and other forms of programming.
