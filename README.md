*The pinned projects below are all mine, with (mostly) my code and coding style*. Feel free to contibute! ‚ù§Ô∏è

My preferred languages are C, Go, Shell/Bash, Python but I can also code in Java and others. I'm mostly interested in systems programming, embedded systems, back-end programming, DevOps / System Administration and other forms of programming.

I like working in a Unix or GNU/Linux environment, and I'm passionate about free software.
