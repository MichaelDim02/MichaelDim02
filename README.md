Hey ðŸ‘‹
I'm Michael, and I like computers! I'm an EE & CS student at IHU.

+ Website: https://mcdim.xyz
+ CV: https://mcdim.xyz/library/cv/cv.pdf

*The pinned projects below are all mine, with (mostly) my code and coding style*. Feel free to contibute!

My preferred languages are C, Go, Shell/Bash, Python but I can also code in Java and others. I'm mostly interested (in no particular order) in systems programming, embedded systems, back-end programming, DevOps / System Administration, Security / Pentesting and other forms of programming.

I like working in a Unix or GNU/Linux environment, and I'm passionate about free software.
